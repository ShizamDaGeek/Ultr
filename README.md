# Info
what is UltraVim?
This is a VIM like TUI code/text editor, that I have been working on in the programming language C.
The reason it's called 'UltraVim' is because it's suppose to be a cooler version of vim, in fact 
half of this readme was typed using UltraVim, now isn't that cool?

Why use UltraVim?
If you area beginner looking into using terminal based code editor, really hate you current editor 
or something different than usual, than this is just the editor for you
