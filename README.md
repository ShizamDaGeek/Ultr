Hello World!
This is a computer software is made by ShizamDa_Geek

# Info
what is UltraVim?
This is a VIM-like TUI code/text editor, that I have been working on in the programming language C.
The reason it's called 'UltraVim' is because it's supposed to be a cooler version of Vim, in fact, 
half of this readme was typed using UltraVim, now isn't that cool?

Why use UltraVim?
If you are a beginner looking into using a terminal-code editor, really hate your current editor 
or something different than usual, then this is just the editor for you

# How to Use
First of all, you will need to download on your operating system:

ü™ü Windows:

Once you have downloaded the software on your computer you will then be able to use UltraVim
